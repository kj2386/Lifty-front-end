As a health conscious individual who likes to keep things organized, I need to be able to log every exercise as I go, so that I can make an informed decision as to what exercise I should do next.

As someone who exercises using the "progressive overload" methodology, I need to be able to see the precise weight and repetitions for each set of an exercise. Knowing this information, I can progressively increase the weights I use in small increments over time.
